                    <h2>Building a Line-Following Robot</h2>
                    <p>I designed a line-following robot that competed in a university challenge against other engineering students.</p>
                </header>

                    <img src="images/chariot.png" alt="" class="main-image" />
                    <p>The robot was designed in Fusion360. I made sure to consider component placement when designing to allow for the
                        easiest possible assembly. I then used the simulation features in Fusion360 to test the fit and alignment of all
                        components.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-container">

                    <p>The chassis was created from laser-cut acrylic parts. These were fitted together before the motor, wheels
                        and ball caster (used for steering) were added. The battery was then added and connected to the motor. The
                        motor was next connected to a microcontroller, which had inputs from a reflectance sensor array. This sensor
                        is what told the robot where the line it needed to follow was.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Add more image-container divs for additional images if needed -->
                <p class="centered-text">An Arduino program was written to read the inputs from the reflectance sensor and then send
                    commands to the motor based on this information. A PID control loop was used and tuned to gradually adjust the motor
                    speed and direction of the robot.
