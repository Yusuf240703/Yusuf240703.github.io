                    <h2>Design & Manufacture of a UAV</h2>
                    <p>I led a team of 30 engineers to design and test the wing of a UAV. This consisted of an iterative design process to choose an aerofoil shape, predicting the wing performance, manufacturing, and testing of the wing.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The aerofoil was chosen by aiming to find a balance between top speed, endurance and maximum lift generation and structural requirements. The chosen aerofoil was NACA 4715.
                        Rib prototypes were designed in Fusion360 and constructed from laser-cut wood, reinforced with CNC cut styrofoam.

                    </div>
                    <p>Pressure tappings were installed at multiple points on the rib leading edges, to allow for data collection
                        during wind tunnel testing. Flap assemblies were also created for the outer wing sections (shown in the photo on the right).

                    </div>
                    <p>The ribs and foam supports were able to be mass-produced, due to the using the automation of the laser cutting
                        and CNC foam cutting machines. The components were then assembled on the front and rear compsite spars.</p>

                    <p>Using multiple aerodynamic performance prediction methods, including simulating the aerofoil in XFLR5 and calculating lift
                        drag coefficients using ESDU sheets, drag polars for different flap settings were calculated (left). The experiental data from
                        the wind tunnel testing is plotted on the right. </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Add more image-container divs for additional images if needed -->
                <p class="centered-text">The shape of the drag polars was similar for the predicted and experiemental data. This continues until the aerofoil
                    stalls, at which point the graph breaks down. The predicted values are much higher for the lift coefficent, and lower for the drag coefficient.
                    This may be due to multiple factors, such as the wing surface not being perfectly smooth, creating additional drag and lowering the potential
                    lift being produced.
